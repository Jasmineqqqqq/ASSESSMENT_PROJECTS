2. Loaded the data
3. Data visualization univariate, bivariate, multivariate
3.1. Categorical -Histogram/count plot-> frequency of the classes
3.2 continuous Density plot -----> density of the data distribution
4. Balanced ===> the frequency of the classes were almost equal
5. Divided my data intd Independent variable(x)
and dependent variable(y)
6.---> categorical data (classes) -> Encoded this variable Label Encoding /OHE/Ordinat encoder/target encoder
7. ---> continuous data ----> skewness of the data --- Skewness was FOUND
#REMOVED THE SKEWNESS USING THE TRANSFORMATION TECHNIQUES Log, square, squareroot, cube root, exponential,etc.
x ----> power transformation ----> shewness was removed.
8. x-=>does not have any shewness (-1,1)or (-4,4)==> normal distribution (-0.5,0.5) (-0.25,0.25)
y --> encoded
9. Checked the data for outliers ====> boxplot- > zscore ==> (-3,3) rule of thumb
#zscore (-3,3) ---> this is the rule thumb > only be calculated for the numerical data (continuous data)
#SKEWNESS, zscore for categorical data > THIS IS INVALID OPERATION.

zscoreca noot be applied on categorical dta even if encoded
